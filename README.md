Overview
========
This Repo has the current theme and layout used for the Seneca 
Online Learning Platform.

Storing the theme on GitHub allowed me to clone it on the right 
server where it is needed, without having to worry!

Theme Authoring
===============
The proposed theming solution for edX provides a number of hooks for
themes to adjust both HTML and CSS to their liking.

See the [the relevant wiki page](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Stanford-Theming) on how to apply the theme.
